# A tool for reading from Hygrochip humidity sensors under Linux

This is a simple program that queries
[Hygrochip](http://www.hygrochip.com/) humidity sensors from Linux.
It was developed and tested with
the HYT-271, but it should work with the other models that use the
same sample code.  See [my blog
post](http://david.wragg.org/blog/2013/01/rpi-humidity.html) for more
details.

To build, just do:

    $ make

And then to run it:

    $ ./hyt-read
    Usage: hyt-read [ -i seconds ] [ -T | -H ] [ -b i2c bus name | device file ]
        -b X    Open the device named X
        -i X    Read data every X seconds
        -T      Print only temperature
        -H      Print only humidity
        -h      Show this message

    $ ./hyt-read i2c-1 0x28
    36.916317 27.065556

The first value returned is the relative humidity as a percentage, the
second is the temperature in degrees C.

You can also use the I2C bus name, i.e. on the Raspberry Pi revision 2:

    ./hyt-read -b bcm2708_i2c.1 0x28

The file `munin_plugin.sh` contains a script contributed by Florian
Heiderich to use this program with the munin monitoring tool.
